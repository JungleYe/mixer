        <h3>What is this thing?</h3>

        <p>The mixer program was created to enhance relationships and communication within different peer groups. The program creates a random pairing of all individuals within each group (at an interval specified by the group) to encourage meeting up. Its up to the chosen pairs to coordinate a time that works for both of them.</p>
